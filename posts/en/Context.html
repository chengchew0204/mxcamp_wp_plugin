    over 5,000 years.
</div>

    in what is now called <div class="hover"><div class="hover-content">

    </div>Oaxaca</div>&hairsp;. The Zapotec language is still common in <em>costeño</em> Oaxaca. The etymology of <em>Zipolite</em> is
    uncertain. Of Nahuatl origin,
        Cipolite or Zipolite [sē·pō·lē·te]  probably means &apos;where snails abound.&apos;
</div>


<div><br><hr>
    <font size="+2">1521</font> — Spanish conquest. Original civilizations in territories now making up the country
    of Mexico were interrupted by practices of genocide and colonization. Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations
    more advanced than parallel European cultures flourished for nearly 5,000 years before the first contact with
    Europeans.

<div><br><hr>
    <font size="+2">1821</font> — Mexican independence.
</div>

<div><br>
    <font size="+2">1955</font> — one family is believed to have occupied Zipolite. Rugged mountains to the north
    and rivers to the east and west had the local descendants of Original People largely isolated from the rest of
    Mexico. The surroundings remained underpopulated and uncensused for two more decades until coastal and inland
    roads were constructed. A persistent Zapotec culture had archeologists find some early C20 pottery identical to
    Preceramic period artefacts—carbon-dating was necessary to make distinctions.

Sabina let him take her picture on the condition that he keep it private, but Wasson nonetheless published the photo along with Sabina's name and the name of the community where she lived. Though he faced no consequences for his deceptions, and indeed, profited greatly from the knowledge he gained from her, Sabina was subsequently ostracised from her community as a result of his actions, and her house was burned down after she was briefly jailed, her son murdered, and she eventually died in poverty.

     coincided with the heyday of the hippie movement. This spectacle of nature has to be considered a
    critical event, as it attracted a few hundred national and foreign backpackers to this remote southernmost <div

    to their homes, those visitors talked about the unknown beach they had discovered. The following winter, a
    considerable number of travellers flocked to the beach, thereby giving birth to a &apos;hippie Eden.&apos;
    Zipolite is not an isolated case in this sense, as other hippie hot spots emerged at approximately the same time
    in Goa (India), Ubud (Indonesia), and Pai (Thailand). Enchanted by the paradisiacal beauty and freedom from law
    enforcement—some stayed, and a small, socially permissive, clothing-optional, and custodial enclave of campers,
    ergo permanent residents, began.
</div>


<div><br><hr>
    <font size="+2">1974</font> — national and foreign backpackers continued to pilgrim to budding 'hammock places'

</div>

<div><br><hr>

    Mexico. Electricity arrived to Zipolite.
</div>

<div><br><hr>
    <font size="+2">1979</font> — Zipolite land, which almost a decade before had been corruptly deeded to private
    interests, was restored to <em>ejido propiedad</em> (communal property) and distributed to approximately three
    dozen local <em>comuneros</em> (coastal land in Oaxaca then, and now, may not be privately deeded).
