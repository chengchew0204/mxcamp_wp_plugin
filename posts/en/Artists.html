In recent years, it has become well-known for the enormously popular annual nudist festival. But within the village lies an even more interesting space known as CAMP. A place to gather, stay, and grow that is specifically designed with &apos;&apos;social architecture to support <i>amongness</i>.&apos;&apos; When you stay, you become part of a social experiment in community. Anthony and Ernesto explain the vision behind this unique venue.&apos;</div>here</div>&hairsp;.</div>

    <h4><p style="margin:65px;"></p>Rest residencies</h4>
    <!-- /wp:html -->
    
    <!-- wp:html -->
    <div>Offering artists a residency for rest is as valuable as offering space for work. We recognize that rest can be the basis for quality art. Hyperbolic production has been normalized. Exhaustion is currency. We want to contradict this by making it possible to give lodging to emptiness. We want to give artists time and space to restore themselves, a regenerative period. We see artist's ceaseless cultivation of answers that bring dynamism, complexity, and enrichment to reality. Inspiration to create may emerge; it is not a condition of the residency. Rest residencies are offered by invitation only. There is no application.</div>
