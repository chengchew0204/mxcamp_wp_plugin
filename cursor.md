## Goal

There used to be a loading spinner when the videos are loading for the events(both event grid in CALENDAR/CALENDARIO), and for events with permalinks.
However, after I hide the video loading spinner for the homepage video background last time, the loading spinners for events were also removed. 
Please bring back the loading spinner for the event videos, but the spinners for the homepage video backgrounds should still remain hidden.
